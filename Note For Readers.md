# Vulnerability-Researches-And-Labs
In this repo, You will find my researches and the labs that I solved about Cyber Security Vulnerabilities. I will add document continuously. My aim is to create cyber security library which can help people who wants to learn about cyber security and also improve themselves in this domain. The most important feature of this library is that it can be easily understood by people of all knowledge levels, and it will show how the learned information can be used in real life (via solved labs). 

Note: Some of the documents are in Turkish Language. Before I decided to create this library, they are my own researches. Therefore, I documented them in Turkish. I will be constantly translating all documents into English.
